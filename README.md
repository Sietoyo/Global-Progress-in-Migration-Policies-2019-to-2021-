### Data Analysis Report: Progress Identification in Migration Policies (2019 to 2021)

#### Objective
The aim of this analysis is to identify countries that have made progress or regressed in their migration policies from 2019 to 2021. This information will help the organization understand global trends in migration policy effectiveness and prioritize regions for further support and intervention.

#### Data Source
United Nations: https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/data/sdg-indicator-1072-migration-policies
#### Summary of Findings
The analysis categorized changes in migration policy scores into three classifications: progress, regression, and no change. The analysis identifies countries that have shown notable improvements or declines in their migration policies.

#### Countries that Made Progress
A total of 19 countries demonstrated progress in their migration policies between 2019 and 2021. These countries improved their scores by either 1 or 2 points, indicating positive changes towards facilitating orderly, safe, regular, and responsible migration and mobility of people.

**Notable Countries:**
- **Botswana**: Improved by 2 points, showing significant advancement.
- **Mexico**: Improved by 2 points, indicating strong policy enhancements.
- **Australia, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Germany, Guinea, Japan, Latvia, Nepal, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, Zambia**: Each of these countries improved by 1 point, reflecting moderate progress in their migration policies.

#### Countries that Regressed
Five countries experienced a regression in their migration policies, with scores decreasing by 1 point. This decline suggests a step back in their efforts to manage migration effectively.

**Notable Countries:**
- **Angola, Bangladesh, Grenada, Paraguay, Senegal**: Each of these countries regressed by 1 point, indicating areas where policy efforts may have weakened or faced challenges.

#### Visualization
A bar chart summarizing the number of countries in each classification (progress, regression, no change) provides a visual representation of the overall trends. The chart highlights the following:
- A significant number of countries (19) made progress.
- A smaller group of countries (5) experienced regression.

#### Detailed Tables
